											<h2>Cirque du soleil</h2>

										<p>On March 20 2020 Cirque du Soleil CEO Daniel Lamarre announced to staff that the company was laying off 95% of its employees. It would lay off 4,679 employees, keeping just 259 staffers to maintain basic operations and continue tour planning and ticket sales for shows scheduled till 2021. The Cirque would rehire if and when productions would be allowed to return to the stage. <br> <br> A technician on one of Cirque’s major touring Big Top shows, who wished to remain anonymous, said that staffers are left with no money because the company expanded too quickly in recent years. "Any surplus we would have had has gone to expanding the company," the technician said. "So now we’re in this precarious situation. And Cirque can’t come out and say, ‘Hey, we’ll give you $500 a week.’ They spent all that money acquiring properties, acquiring companies that may or may not be making Cirque any money. All of this comes from upper management, and I can tell you that every one of us who works for Cirque thought they were overexpanding and that they’d been diluting the brand. It’s just so oversaturated. Then something like this happens and none of us have any income." <br> <br> Lamarre rejected the argument that the company was overextended, that it was already in precarious financial shape before the COVID-19 crisis and that the brand was diluted. <br> <br> Cirque du Soleil chose to protect itself from its creditors in court. The company had no revenues, but a large debt on which it had to pay interest every month. Catalyst Capital, a leading European real estate investment and asset management group bought a portion of Cirque's debt at a discount in August 2020. And in November 2020 Catalyst took the ownership of Cirque. In the jargon of the financial community, this type of firm is often nicknamed a "vulture" fund. It targets companies in financial difficulty and acquires them at a low price in order to turn them around and make a profit by reselling them in a few years. <br> <br> Despite some evil tongues, the company still succeeds in pushing the limits of what is possible. At the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida's Disney Springs, there is a brand-new Cirque du Soleil production called "Drawn to Life". It's a modern circus show with gymnasts, acrobats, and other accomplished artists. It is the result of Walt Disney Animation Studios, Walt Disney Imagineering, and Cirque du Soleil working together. The animation technique and Disney's animated film creations serve as inspiration for the show. It is presented in a specially designed standalone theater that was constructed for La Nouba, the show's predecessor, which closed in 2017 after 19 years of operation. Disney revealed on August 17, 2021, that tickets would go on sale on August 20 for shows starting on November 18, 2021. On November 18, 2021, the show made its debut in public as a part of Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration. <br> <br> What is Cirque's vision of the future ? Cirque du Soleil announced on November 30, 2021, that Daniel Lamarre would step down as president and CEO of the company and become executive vice chairman of the board, with former chief financial officer and chief operating officer Stéphane Lefebvre taking over as president and CEO on December 1, 2021. But on May 13, 2022, Daniel Lamarre discussed with Harvard Business Review editor in chief Adi Ignatius on how to put creativity at the center of strategy: "Creativity has to be at the forefront, because if you don’t do that, then one day you will wake up and you will discover that your competitors have an edge on you and then you’re in trouble. So don’t wait for that. Just make sure that you are nurturing your creativity within the organization to keep your edge, to keep your leadership in whatever sector you are." <br> <br> And Cirque launched two new shows. In May 2022, Mad Apple was premiered at New New York-New York, Las Vegas. April 2023 saw the birth of a touring show: "High-level acrobatics will be woven within a striking and disruptive visual universe. We are thrilled to announce Cirque du Soleil Echo, a new Big Top show that will premiere in the Old Port of Montreal."</p>


										<p> <strong>Strategic audit</strong> <br> <br> Your mission herewith is to investigate, and conduct a strategic audit of Cirque du Soleil. Analyze the history of the company from the day of its creation. Find out if the inability to stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic was the result of weak corporate planning, and/or mistakes in the management of operations, prior to the recent health crisis. Finally, you recommend how Cirque could bounce back.</p>
